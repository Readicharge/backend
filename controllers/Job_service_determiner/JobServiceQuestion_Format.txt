    "r1":value for r1

and so on mapping this to the excel sheet Job Quote mapping

So for the complete job Mapping section , 

We are first going to identify the nature of the job
                    |
Then we are going to decide the number of Installs we want to have 
                    |
Then We are going to detemine that what are the additional cose which are needed here
                    |
This above thing will be done for all the chargers 
                    |
The comparison is done and the one with the more amount is alloted as the Installation type for all the chargers
                    |
The Customer will see the total amount he has to pay and the booking is done on this price only,
However the installer will get the stippend amount of the material cost 
and his labor charge
